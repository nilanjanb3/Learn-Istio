- mTLS between services
- Service-to-service authentication
- Identity-based authorization (SPIFFE/SPIRE)

**Hands-On:**
- Enable strict mTLS
- Verify certificates and secure communication
- Apply peer & request authentication policies

**Use Cases:**
- Enforcing secure comms in regulated environments

---

### **Day 6: Authorization & Policy Enforcement**
**Concepts:**
- AuthorizationPolicy
- Access Control based on JWT, IP, Namespace, etc.
- Rate limiting (with Envoy or external adapter)

**Hands-On:**
- Define fine-grained RBAC for services
- Block unauthorized access with policies
- Apply rate-limiting policies

**Use Cases:**
- API protection, secure multi-tenant architectures

---

### **Day 7: Ingress Gateway, Egress, and TLS Termination**
**Concepts:**
- Istio Gateway vs Kubernetes Ingress
- TLS termination
- Egress traffic control
- External service access

**Hands-On:**
- Configure Istio Ingress Gateway
- Secure app with HTTPS
- Monitor and restrict egress traffic

**Use Cases:**
- Secure APIs with TLS, control data exfiltration

---

### **Day 8: Istio in Production**
**Concepts:**
- Best practices for production deployments
- Istio upgrades and versioning
- Configuration profiles
- Multi-tenancy and multi-cluster deployment overview

**Hands-On:**
- Use revision-based upgrades
- Create custom IstioOperator configs
- Enable access logs and audit trails

---

### **Day 9: Real-world Integrations**
**Concepts:**
- Istio with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, ArgoCD, GitOps)
- Istio with Service Discovery and DNS
- Using Istio with other observability stacks (e.g., Loki)

**Hands-On:**
- Automate traffic shifting with CI/CD
- Trigger rollout with GitOps changes
- Observe trace correlation via logs

---

### **Day 10: Troubleshooting & Debugging Istio**
**Concepts:**
- Common failure scenarios
- Debugging tools: `istioctl`, Envoy admin, `kubectl`
- Logging and performance tuning

**Hands-On:**
- Debug Envoy config
- Use `istioctl analyze`, `proxy-status`
- Fix broken routes and policies

---
