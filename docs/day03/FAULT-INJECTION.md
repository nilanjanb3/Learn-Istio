### 📌 Istio Fault Injection

---

### 🚧 **What is Fault Injection?**

**Fault Injection** in Istio is a feature that allows you to **simulate failures** (like delays or errors) in your service mesh. It helps test how your applications behave under **unreliable network conditions** or **service failures**.

> ✅ It’s useful for **resiliency testing**, **chaos engineering**, and **verifying fallback mechanisms**.

---

### 🛠️ **Types of Faults You Can Inject**

1. **Delays**
   Simulate high latency by introducing artificial delay in responses.

2. **Aborts (HTTP errors)**
   Simulate service failures by returning specific HTTP error codes (e.g., 500, 403).

### 🧪 Example 1: Inject a 5s Delay for 100% of Traffic

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - fault:
      delay:
        fixedDelay: 5s
        percent: 100
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```

➡️ Every request to the `reviews` service gets delayed by 5 seconds.

---

### 🧪 Example 2: Abort 50% of Requests with HTTP 500

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings
  http:
  - fault:
      abort:
        httpStatus: 500
        percent: 50
    route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings
        subset: v1
```

➡️ 50% of traffic to `ratings` will return HTTP 500 errors.

---

### 🔁 **You Can Combine Delay and Abort**

```yaml
fault:
  delay:
    fixedDelay: 2s
    percent: 100
  abort:
    httpStatus: 503
    percent: 10
```

➡️ 100% of traffic is delayed by 2s, and 10% of it is aborted with HTTP 503.

### 🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**

| Use Case                   | Fault Type        | Why Use It                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Test retry logic           | Delay + Abort     | Ensure clients retry on failure                   |
| Test circuit breaker       | Abort (e.g., 500) | Verify that it triggers under stress              |
| Validate timeouts          | Delay             | Confirm service handles slow responses gracefully |
| Practice chaos engineering | Any               | Build confidence in fault tolerance               |

### ✅ Summary

| Fault Type   | Description               | Example                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Delay**    | Adds latency to responses | Simulate slow downstream services |
| **Abort**    | Returns error codes       | Simulate failures or outages      |
| **Combined** | Mix delay and abort       | More realistic test scenarios     |

> Fault injection is **non-destructive**—only affects routing in the **VirtualService**, not your actual service code.
