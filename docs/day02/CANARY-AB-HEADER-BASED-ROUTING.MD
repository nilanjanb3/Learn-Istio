### 📌 Istio Traffic Routing: Canary Deployments, A/B Testing, Header-Based Routing

---

Istio enables **advanced traffic routing** between microservices using simple YAML configurations. These routing features help teams **deploy safely**, **experiment with features**, and **target specific user groups**.

---

### 🚦 1. **Canary Deployments**

Canary deployment is a technique where **a small percentage of traffic** is sent to a new version of a service (`v2`), while the rest continues to use the stable version (`v1`).

#### ✅ Purpose:
- Reduce risk of bugs affecting all users
- Gradually shift traffic as confidence increases

#### 🧪 Example: Route 10% to `v2`, 90% to `v1`
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```

> 🔧 Requires a corresponding `DestinationRule` with `subsets` for `v1` and `v2`.

---

### 🧪 2. **A/B Testing**

A/B testing is used to **split traffic between versions based on user-specific data**, like headers or cookies. Unlike canary, it doesn’t use percentages — it routes based on specific conditions.

#### ✅ Purpose:
- Test different versions for different users
- Collect behavioral data

#### 🧪 Example: Route users with `x-user-type: beta` to `v2`
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: productpage
spec:
  hosts:
  - productpage
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        x-user-type:
          exact: beta
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        subset: v1
```

> Only users with header `x-user-type: beta` go to `v2`. All others go to `v1`.

---

### 🧭 3. **Header-Based Routing**

Header-based routing sends requests to different service versions based on the **content of request headers** — useful for:
- Feature toggles
- Device-specific versions (mobile vs desktop)
- Role-based access

#### 🧪 Example: Route if `user-agent` contains `mobile`
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  hosts:
  - frontend
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        user-agent:
          regex: ".*mobile.*"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: mobile
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: default
```

---

### 🧩 Supporting Configuration: DestinationRule

You must define service **subsets** (like `v1`, `v2`, `beta`) using labels via a `DestinationRule`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

### 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | Technique | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Deploying a risky feature | **Canary** | Gradually release to 5%, then 25%, then 100% |
| Testing feature for certain users | **A/B Testing** | Route beta users based on custom header |
| Optimizing experience by device | **Header Routing** | Route mobile users to lighter version |

### ✅ Summary

| Routing Type      | Control Based On         | Best For                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Canary**         | % of traffic               | Safe, gradual rollouts          |
| **A/B Testing**    | Headers/Cookies           | Controlled feature experiments  |
| **Header Routing** | User-agent, roles, etc.   | Device/segment specific routing |
